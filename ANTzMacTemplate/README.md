ANTz - immersive data visualization
====
ANTz is an interactive realtime 3D data visualization tool for cognizance of complex systems. Think of it as 'spreadsheet meets cyberspace.' An immersive multi-dimensional spatially based environment for realtime analysis and decision making. Capable of combining stored data with live sources for time sensitive situations. It is good for finding the proverbial 'needle in the haystack.' The visual environment enables a more efficient mechanism for identifying patterns and relationships. Data fields are mapped to parameters such as geometry, transparency, velocity and position. Spatial cues based on shape, color, size and texture enable the user to identify key patterns. The ultimate goal is to close the cognitive loop between users and powerful logic engines known as computers.
