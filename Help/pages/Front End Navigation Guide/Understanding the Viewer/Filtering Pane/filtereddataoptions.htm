<h3 style="text-align:center;">Filtered Data Options</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>At the very bottom of the filter pane, there are 3 buttons that allow you to pull up underlying source data as well as create and save unique views. </li>
	<ul>
		<br/><li>Show Filtered Data:</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>
			<li>After all desired filters are applied, clicking on this button will bring up the underlying data in an Excel spreadsheet for the objects that meet your filtering criteria</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<br/><li>Create Subset Visualization:</li>
	</ul>
		<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>If you decide, after applying all desired filters, that you would like to be able to revisit that specific view without having to reapply those filters, using Create Subset Visualization will save a version of the view as a separate file (think of this as the “save as” feature). You can then name the view and open it in the viewer at a later time using File -> Open Visualization, CTRL + O, or clicking on My Views on the home page and selecting this new view.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

	<ul>
		<br/><li>Show Selected Data:</li>
	</ul>
		<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>1.	This feature allows you to pull up source data on selected (not filtered) glyphs. Single objects can be selected by clicking on them, and multiple objects can be selected by holding down the SHIFT key and dragging a bounding box with your mouse over the area of glyphs you’d like to select. If you selected a single object, but have filtered on many, Show Selected Data will <b>only</b> bring up the <b>selected</b> data.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

	<br/><li>Hide Filtered Checkbox:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>When the Hide Filtered checkbox is checked, all data that is filtered will drop off of the screen completely, showing only the objects that meet the criteria filtered on.</li>
		<li>When the Hide Filtered checkbox is <b>un</b>checked, glyphs that do not meet the filter criteria will stay on screen but become transparent.
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
