	<ul>
		<br/><li>A separate window with the glyph legend that can be turned on and off as needed.  (NOTE:  Once you have used the visualization for a bit, you will begin to remember the legend.  But, just in case, you can always turn it back on.) Turning the glyph legend on will allow you to see the legend, regardless of where you are in the 3D space.</li>
