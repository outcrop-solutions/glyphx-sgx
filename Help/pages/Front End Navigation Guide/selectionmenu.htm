		<ol>
  			<li>Start in the left pane and choose one of the following views:</li>
  				
  				<ul>
  					<br/><li>Global Admissions: Simple overview of all applicants over time by admission decision status</li>
  					<li>Reader: A more detailed view of a reader's applicant pool.</li>
  					<li>High School: High schools with 10 or more applicants for the current year plus all previous applicants from that school.</li>
  					<li>Class Composition: Breakdown of diversity cohorts by year and admission status.</li>
  					<li>Global Dashboard: Every cohort and admit status by admission counselor and total class composition. </li>
  				</ul>
  			
  			<br/><li>Once a view is selected, the panes to the right will show the filter selection options within that view. Only one reader or high school can be selected in the Reader and High School Views. For all other views, multiple selections can be made within each column using CTRL + select (single non-contiguous) or SHIFT + select (contiuous entries), or the Select All button located in the upper right-hand corner of each column.</li>
			<br/><li>Once at least one selection is made in each filter column, click on "Load Visualization" at the top right of the screen to launch the visualization (see below). If you have not selected at least one option in each column, a pop-up will appeacr prompting you to complete your selection choices.</li>
