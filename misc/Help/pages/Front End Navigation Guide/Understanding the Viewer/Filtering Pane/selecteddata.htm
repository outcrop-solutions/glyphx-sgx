			<li>This feature allows you to pull up source data on selected (not filtered) glyphs. Single objects can be selected by clicking on them, and multiple objects can be selected by holding down the SHIFT key and dragging a bounding box with your mouse over the area of glyphs youâ€™d like to select. If you selected a single object, but have filtered on many, Show Selected Data will <b>only</b> bring up the <b>selected</b> data.
