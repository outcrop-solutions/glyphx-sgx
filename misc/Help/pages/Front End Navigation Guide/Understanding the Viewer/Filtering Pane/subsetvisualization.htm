			<li>If you decide, after applying all desired filters, that you would like to be able to revisit that specific view without having to reapply those filters, using Create Subset Visualization will save a version of the view as a separate file (think of this as the “save as” feature). You can then name the view and open it in the viewer at a later time using File -> Open Visualization, CTRL + O, or clicking on My Views on the home page and selecting this new view.</li>
