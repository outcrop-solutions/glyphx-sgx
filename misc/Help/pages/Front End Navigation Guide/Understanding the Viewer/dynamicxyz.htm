	<ul>
		<br/><li>This button on the toolbar allows you to change which fields are used as the x/y/z coordinates. If, for example, youâ€™re in the High School view and decide you would be more interested in seeing GPA on the Y axis rather than Non-Academic Rating, you would click on the toolbar button and see this screen:</li>
			
		<br/><center><img src="images/image024.png" alt="Dynamic_Axis"/></center>

		<br/><li>From here, you can scroll through the list of available fields in the bottom half of the popup window and choose which fields to replace the axis with.</li>
		<li>Drag and drop the field you wish to replace an axis into the top half of the popup window, and click okay. Your new visualization should appear on screen.</li>
	</ul>
