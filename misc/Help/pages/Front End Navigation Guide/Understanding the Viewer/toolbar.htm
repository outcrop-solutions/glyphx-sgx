	<ul>
		<br/><li>Here, there are 7 icons to turn on and off the features surrounding the main visualization screen. From left to right: legend, text properties, filtering, time animated filtering, show/hide compass rose, show/hide scene axis, and change XYZ axes.</li>

		<br/><center><img src="images/image010.png" alt="Toolbar_All"/></center>

		<br/><li>There is also a checkbox to turn the filter view on and off, which is also available on the filtering pane. When this box checked, objects will disappear on the screen as the user filters down the data. When this box is unchecked, objects not within the filtered (selected) dataset will become transparent on the screen, not disappearing entirely. </li>
